<h2>How to buy salmon</h2>
<h3>Types of salmon</h3>
<p>Any salmon is a good choice! The worst salmon is better for your heart than chicken or almost
    anything else.
</p>
<p>Sockeye (aka Red or Blueback Salmon) is the healthiest. It may also be called "Wild Alaskan
    Salmon".</p>
<details>
    <summary>It should be a deep red color.</summary>

<p>Chinook (aka King Salmon) is second best.</p>
<details>
    <summary>It should be a dark orange or red color.</summary>

</details>

<p>If neither is available, Coho Salmon is next best, or just get the darkest red/orange color with
    the least amount of white you can find. Beware that Farmed Atlantic Salmon might be artificially
    colored to make it redder, wild of any type is generally better, but do what works for your
    budget.</p>

<p>Prefer "fresh" over "previously frozen" for taste, no effect on health.</p>

<h3>Instructions for fish guy</h3>
<p>No matter what you choose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Buy FILLETS (look like the above photos), not steaks</li>
    <li>Buy 1/3 to 1/4 lb per portion you are going to cook, i.e. a little more than 1/2 lb
        for two portions, or 1lb for 3 portions, is good
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask the fish market guy to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Remove the skin</li>
    <li>Remove the bones</li>
    <li>Cut into X number of fillets (one fillet per portion)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>COOKED salmon will last ~1 week in the fridge.</p>
<p>FRESH salmon will last about 2 days in the fridge. You can tell if it has gone bad if it is
    slimy, and/or it has a much stronger fishy smell.
</p>
<p>You can FREEZE any fresh salmon you buy, and it will last ~6 months in the freezer.
    <br/>NOTE: If you plan to freeze it all anyway, see if you can buy frozen salmon (not
    "previously frozen", actual frozen salmon).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Remove it from the wrapping it was sold in</li>
    <li>Put it in a freezer bag (i.e. ziplock)</li>
    <li>Remove the air from the bag</li>
    <li>Put it in the coldest part of the freezer</li>
</ul>
